{"cursor":"26958","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Military organization' is the structuring of the armed forces of a state so as\nto offer military capability required by the national defence policy. In some\ncountries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces. Armed\nforces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as\ninsurgent forces, often mimic military organizations, or use ad hoc structures.\n\nMilitary organization is hierarchical. The use of formalized ranks in a\nhierarchical structure came into widespread use with the Roman Army. In modern\ntimes, executive control, management and administration of military\norganizations is typically undertaken by the government through a government\ndepartment within the structure of public administration, often known as a\nDepartment of Defense, Department of War, or Ministry of Defence. These in turn\nmanage Armed Services that themselves command combat, combat support and service\nsupport formations and units.\n","linknr":607,"url":"Formation_(military)","recorded":1362375015,"links":45,"instances":["china","soviet_army","rank","air_force_unit","military","disambiguation","military_unit","polity","air_force_unit","military","aviation","ship","military_unit","army","military_formation","military","rank","rank","government","rank","military_unit","brazil","land_and_air","disambiguation","government_department","world_war_ii"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military
