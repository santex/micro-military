Essentially, it is kidnapping by\n  military or intelligence forces.\n* 'Friendly': The subject involved is willing and is expected to cooperate with\n  the personnel in the operation.\n\nOne such example of a friendly extraction was the joint US Central Intelligence\nAgency-Canadian government operation to smuggle six fugitive American diplomatic\npersonnel out of revolutionary Iran in 1980 in an operation later known as the\nCanadian Caper. Another notable exfiltration is Operation Entebbe in 1976, when\nIsraeli forces raided Entebbe Airport in Uganda to rescue 102 hostages.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Extraction_(military)","recorded":1362669759,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Maneuver tactics"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Helicopter_Extraction-Tal_Afar_Iraq.jpg/220px-Helicopter_Extraction-Tal_Afar_Iraq.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg/30px-Icon_vojn.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["United_States_Army","Military_tactics","Kidnapping","United_States_of_America","Central_Intelligence_Agency","Canada","Iran","Canadian_Caper","Operation_Entebbe","Israel","Entebbe_Airport","Uganda","Infiltration_tactics","Landing_zone"]}
