{"cursor":"4328","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA strategic military goal is used in strategic planning to define desired end-\nstate of a war or a campaign. Usually it entails either a strategic change in\nenemy's military posture, p.14, Gartner intentions or ongoing\noperations, or achieving a strategic victory over the enemy that ends the\nconflict, although the goal can be set in terms of diplomatic or economic\nconditions, defined by purely territorial gains, or the evidence that the\nenemy's will to fight has been broken. p.91, Newell Sometimes the\nstrategic goal can be to limit the scope of the conflict. p.29, Aron\n\nIt is the highest level of organisational achievement in a military\norganisation, and is usually defined by the national defence policy. In terms of\ngoal assignment it corresponds to operations performed by a front or a fleet on\na theatre scale, and by an Army group or, during the Second World War, by a Red\nArmy Front.\n\nA strategic goal is achieved by reaching specific strategic objectives that\nrepresent intermediary and incremental advances within the overall strategic\nplan. This is necessary because \"high-level\" strategic goals are often abstract,\nand therefore difficult to assess in terms of achievement without referring to\nsome specific, often physical objectives. p.31, Gartner However, aside\nfrom the obstacles used by the enemy to prevent achievement of the strategic\ngoal, inappropriate technological capabilities and operational weakness in\ncombat may prevent fulfilment of the strategic plan. p.18, Millett\nMurray As an example, these are illustrated by the failure of the Royal\nAir Force's Bomber Command during the winter of 1943/44. p.19, Millett\nMurray\n\n A critical product of the analysis which leads to the strategic\ndecision to use military force is determination of the national goal to be\nachieved by that application of force. p.59, Newell \n\nHowever, analysis of military history abounds with examples of the two factors\nthat plague goal setting in military strategies, their change during the\ncampaign or war due to changes in economic, political or social changes within\nthe state, or in a change of how achievement of existing goal is being assessed,\nand the criteria of its achievement. For example,  The complex and\nvaried nature of the Vietnam War made it especially difficult to translate\nabstract, strategic goals into specific missions for individual\norganizations. p.121, Gartner \n\nThis occurred because aside from the economic change that saw cost of war\nescalate beyond original predictions, and the change in political leadership was\nno longer willing to commit to the conduct of war, but also to the radical\nchange which the United States society experienced during the war, and more\nimportantly because  The American strategic goal was not the\ndestruction of an organized military machine armed with tanks, planes,\nhelicopters, and war ships, for which the United States had prepared, but the\npreservation of a fragile regime from the lightly armed attacks of both its own\npeople and the North Vietnamese. pp.127-128, Gartner  The\nUnited States did not intend to conquer North Vietnam for fear of a Chinese or\nSoviet military reaction. Likewise, the United States strategically assumed that\nthe full extent of its power was not merited in Vietnam.
