{"cursor":"2483","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Mobility' in military terms refers to the ability of a weapon system, combat\nunit or armed force to move toward a military objective. Combat forces with a\nhigher mobility are able to move more quickly, and/or across more hostile\nterrain, than forces with lower mobility.\n\nMobility is regarded as a vital component of the modern battlefield, as the\nability to deliver weapon systems or combat units to their objective quickly can\noften mean the difference between victory and defeat. Armies around the world\nhave massively increased their mobility over the last one hundred years. In\nWorld War I, for example, most combat units could only move on the battlefield\nas fast as a soldier could walk, resulting in stalemate and an inability to\noutmaneuver the enemy. By World War II, battlefield mobility had greatly\nimproved with the development of the tank, and with tracked and other mechanized\nvehicles to move forces to and from the battlefront.\n\nSince the end of World War II, armies have continued to develop their mobility.\nBy the 1980s, for example, intercontinental travel shifted from sea to air\ntransport, enabling military forces to move from one part of the world to\nanother within hours or days instead of weeks. Mobility has also been referred\nto as a combat multiplier. A highly mobile unit can use its mobility to engage\nmultiples of its own combat strength of less mobile units ie; German panzer\ndivisions in world war two were considered the equivalent of two or three\ninfantry divisions partly due to their superior mobility and partly due to\ninherently greater firepower.\n\nMobility has also been defined in terms of three generally recognised levels of\nwarfare; tactical , operational, strategic. Tactical mobility is usually defined\nas the ability to move under fire. Operational mobility is usually defined as\nthe ability to move men and materiel to the decisive point of battle. Strategic\nmobility is the ability to move an army to the area of operations.\n\nIn WWI most armies lacked tactical mobility but enjoyed good strategic mobility\nthrough the use of railroads thus leading to a situation where armies could be\ndeployed to the front with ease and rapidity , but once they reached the front\nbecame bogged down by their inability to move under fire.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Mobility_(military)","recorded":1372152965,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Weapon_system","/wiki/Combat_unit","/wiki/Military_objective","/wiki/Terrain","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Tank","/wiki/Vehicle","/wiki/Battlefront","/wiki/Sea_transport","/wiki/Air_transport","/wiki/File:Icon_vojn.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg/30px-Icon_vojn.svg.png","/wiki/Military","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Mil-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Mil-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Mil-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&oldid=531599443","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Military_terminology","/wiki/Category:Military_transport","/wiki/Category:Military_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Military_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_August_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mobility+%28military%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mobility+%28military%29","/wiki/Mobility_(military)","/wiki/Talk:Mobility_(military)","#","/wiki/Mobility_(military)","/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mobility_(military)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mobility_(military)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&oldid=531599443","/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Mobility_%28military%29&id=531599443","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Mobility+%28military%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Mobility+%28military%29&oldid=531599443&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Mobility_(military)&printable=yes","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6887290#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_(military)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military
